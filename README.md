## The Marxian Split - A Communist Bill Splitting Calculator
A calculator to figure how to split bills among individuals, based on their relative ability to pay.

"Each to their need receives, each to their ability pays."

(Here is a Medium post I wrote about this tool - https://medium.com/unhype/a-marxian-split-460365e079ed)

### How to Run the Calculator
1. Run '/calc.js' code in your developer console
2. Follow the prompts
3. Read the console to see the amounts to be paid

### How it works
1. You enter the total amount of the bill to be split
2. You enter the total annual income of each of the 2 payers
3. Karl Marx walks into a bar...
4. You get the proportionate amount each payer should contribute based on their ability to pay.
5. Workers of the world unite, and split the bar tab.
